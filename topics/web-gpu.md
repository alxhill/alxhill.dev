* Lets learn WebGPU! GPUs are cool and proper compute from the web is also cool. So lets see if we can build something interesting here - either, port the Ray Tracer to run on WebGPU, or write a tensor library/something ML related and see if we can run any interesting models in the browser.
* Have not written real JavaScript/TypeScript since before await/async. So there's a learning curve for both of those then.
