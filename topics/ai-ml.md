## AI / ML Dev Log

Roughly reverse chronological dev-log of my journey trying to learn modern AI / ML topics.

### 2022-11-11

* Bought Colab Pro only to try and make it run locally (update: only sorta worked so good thing I did)
* Python dependencies remain absolute hell and I will never forgive them for it
* Got the diffusers stuff working with a downloaded copy. Turns out the checkpoints are not in the same format as the diffusers stuff, interesting.
* Using diffusers lib does feel like I'm not learning anything - just using it. For now, lets enjoy what we have...
* After wayyy too much messing around with python BS, I have it setup and working on both Colab and local. Colab credits seem to be running out faster than I'd hoped so local might have to be prioritised, even though MPS backend is pretty unstable at the moment. (Update: had a bunch of dependency/conda issues running Colab locally on the M2 Air, should figure out at some point. Maybe just needs ipykernel or something)
* Idea: make the interiorai thing as a huggingface space? Just as a POC?
* Actually the autocorrect product as a huggingface space would also be interesting, saves me having to download and run it all locally too ðŸ¤”
* CycleDiffusion looks interesting here - converting from one image to another.
* After way too long, finally got a decent load/save images thing working. Sucks how hard the basics are with an unfamiliar language.
