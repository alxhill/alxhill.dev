## Rust Dev Log

Reverse chronological dev-log of my journey trying to learn Rust.

### 2022-??-??

_Adding some writeups here a few days after actually trying to use Rust_

* Started with CLion + the Rust plugin.
* Had some very interesting conversations with ChatGPT, useful for asking for example "starter code", as well as some more conceptual questions. Hard to know if it's correct (and asking specific questions about e.g config/obscure errors was definitely not giving correct answers), but I did validate a few things.
* Decided a Ray Tracer would be a fun starter project, complex enough to actually learn the language but interesting enough to see it through. Might be a little challenging, but the Ray Tracing from the Ground Up book includes lots of C++ that shouldn't be toooo hard to convert directly to Rust. Plus, I have the C++ ray tracer made at university still floating around somewhere...
